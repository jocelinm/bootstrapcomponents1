          The iPad, also known colloquially as the iPad 3, is a tablet computer designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The third-generation iPad was available in nine different configurations in the United States and Canada, compared to six in the rest of the world, though some countries only had the Wi-Fi only model. Each variant was available with black or white front glass panels and storage capacities of 16, 32, or 64 GB. On March 16, 2012, the tablet was released in ten countries. It received mostly positive feedback, with praise for its Retina display, processor, and 4G (LTE) capabilities. However, when the LTE incompatibilities were revealed, they sparked debate. In the first three days, three million units were sold. iOS 5.1, which was made available on March 7, 2012, came pre-installed on the third-generation iPad. [40] If it is a Wi-Fi + Cellular model, it can function as a hotspot with select carriers, sharing its internet connection by Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or USB. [41] It may also access the Apple-created and -maintained App Store, a digital application delivery channel for iOS. Users of the service can browse and download apps from the iTunes Store that were created using Xcode and the iOS SDK and distributed by Apple. Safari, Mail, Photos, Videos, YouTube, Music, iTunes, App Store, Maps, Notes, Calendar, Game Center, Photo Booth, and Contacts are just a some of the pre-installed programs on the iPad. The phone has a VGA front-facing videophone camera for FaceTime and an Apple A5X SoC with a 1 GHz dual-core 32-bit Cortex-A9 CPU and a quad-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 GPU. It also has 1 GB of RAM, a 5-megapixel rear camera that can record 1080p video, and a rear-facing camera with a resolution of 1080p.
