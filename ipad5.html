        <li>The iPad 9.7-inch (officially iPad 5th generation) is an Apple Inc. tablet computer that was designed, developed, and marketed. Following its March 21, 2017 announcement, conflicting naming conventions resulted in a variety of names, including "seventh-generation iPad" or "iPad (2017)." With a 9.7-inch (25 cm) screen, 7.5mm thickness, and differences such as the lack of a physical mute switch, smaller microphone holes, and only a single row of speaker holes, the fifth generation iPad shares most design elements with the iPad Air. The processor has been upgraded from the Apple A8X to the A9 with the embedded Apple M9 motion co-processor, compared to the iPad Air 2. It has storage capacities of 32 and 128 GB. The iPad shipped with iOS 10, a version of Apple's mobile operating system, when it was first released. In contrast to the iPad Pro lineup, this iPad has only two speakers (rather than four), no Smart Connector support, and no camera flash. [It is available in silver, gold, and space grey. Despite using the Apple A9 processor and M9 motion co-processor, which were introduced with the iPhone 6S in 2015, the iPad does not support always-on "Hey Siri" voice input, a feature advertised as being made possible by low-power processing in the then-new chips. After the Fall 2017 release of iOS 11, all new units sold include the new operating system. The Touch ID fingerprint sensor included in the device enables the user to unlock the device as well as approve purchases from the App Store, iTunes Store, and iBooks Store. Touch ID and Apple Pay allow users to purchase items from websites or apps.</li>
